      "Reconstruction: The Vickers Vagabond was a small experimental light aircraft, with an unusual'sneeping' tail arrangement. It was an unsuccessful contender for the first Lympne competition for single seat motor-gliders, held in 1923 and a very limited number were built. Following trials in 1924 at Lympne, the Air Ministry introduced a second competition, this time for two-seat motor-gliders. The aircraft was conventionally equipped with a small high-mounted engine, so the process was eliminated. The two-seat time limit set was 1,100 cc.\n",

Several companies built aircraft for them, including the Blackburn Bluebird, Hawker Cygnet, Supermarine Sparrow and two from Westland, the Woodpigeon and Widgeon. The Type 98 Vagabond was Vickers' entry. It was a single-bay, wire-braced biplane with wings of constant chord except towards the rounded trailing tips. The wings had equal span and carried marked stagger.\n",

It was a conventional single-bay biplane with a small tail and very light construction; engines had to be removed during testing to control them. Following unsuccessful trials, the Vickers team organised another competition in September 1924, just like the first, which was held at Blackburn. It was an entry from Lyneham for the Airmail Scheme. The Vickers Vagabond was a single-bay, low-wing monoplane with a range of speeds ranging from. The aircraft had two wings of two conventional types, the Wooden Sparrow and the single-engined Supermarine Cygnet, although at one point the two aircraft were fitted with tailless floats. The leading edge had a limited speed and hence carried the same stagger indicator. The programme was set at 4,100 lb.\n",
      "sentence4 = The Vickers Vagabond was a rare experimental aircraft from the Vickers company, with a very small wingspan. It was a simple low-winged monoplane, unusual in that it had no separate controls for storage or transport. It was built in 1924 as the company's first attempt at low-wing competition, for the second time. The competition was held during 1924 and the first prize was a £100 prize. Following delays caused by the Second World War, the Lympne trials were cancelled. The Air Ministry set up a trials programme for small-winged aircraft, organised again in late September 1924, at which time the Airman's Cyclone eJava was built. Two other aircraft, the Blackburn Wildcat and Hawker Siddeley Spitfire, were built at the same time. These aircraft were of conventional layout and their speed range was restricted to just under 1,000 mph, except for a few technical entries. The wings were of single-bay construction, one wing for the two tailplanes, one for the glider. The wings had a constant area between them, fitted with tapered, curved wires. The Blackburn wing bore characteristic V-shaped points and had marked staggered leading edges.\n",

      "sentence6 = The Vickers Vagabond was a novel single-seat light aircraft built in 1924 for the Vickers company. It was the first attempt at a conventional single-seat motor glider. It was a very small aircraft with a limited empty weight, only, and was unusual for its fast handling. Following an investigation into wing-tip compression, the Air Ministry suspended the trials at the end of 1924, except for two test flights. The Second Airplane Trials were held during September 1924 and another trial took place soon afterwards. It was organised by Vickers' aircraft supplier, Lyman Woods, in late March 1924. The aircraft was built in two basic categories; the Bluebird, a single-seat biplane, and the Blackbird, a twin-seat monoplane. Unlike the earlier Lyman wood-built gliders, these had a conventional wing, with wings of equal span and width. The engines were from Hawker Siddeley Spitfire and the wings could be set to control the speed for easy transport. Each stage carried four wooden floats, one each for the rudder, tailplane and ailerons. The Bluebird had narrow wing edges and showed marked stamina.\n"
