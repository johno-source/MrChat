      "Vickers Vagabond\n",
      "The Vickers Vagabond was Vickers' entrant for the second Lympne light aircraft competition, held in 1924.  It was a conventional small biplane, with a very unusual method of trimming.  It was eliminated from the trials at an early stage and only one was built.\n",
      "\n",
      "Development\n",
      "Following the first Lympne trials held in 1923 for single-seat motor-gliders, the Air Ministry organised a similar event in 1924, this time for low-powered two-seat aircraft.  The engine capacity limit was set at 1,100 cc. and, as before, the wings had to fold for easy transport and storage.  The trials took place between 29 September and 4 October.  Several companies built aircraft for them, including the Blackburn Bluebird, Hawker Cygnet, Supermarine Sparrow and two from Westland, the Woodpigeon and Widgeon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Type 98 Vagabond was Vickers' entry. It was a single-bay, wire-braced biplane with wings of constant chord except towards the rounded trailing tips.  The wings had equal span and carried marked stagger. There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings, with flaps inboard on the lower wings which could be folded to assist wing-folding.  The pilot and passenger sat in open cockpits, the latter under the upper wing.  The pilot's upward view was enhanced by a small cutout in the trailing edge of the top wing.  The fuselage had a more rounded cross-section than that of the earlier Viget, Vickers' single-seat entry to the 1923 competition, extending a little below the lower wing.  The 32 hp (24 kW)  Bristol Cherub III flat twin engine was mounted in a smooth nose with the finned cylinders exposed for air cooling.  The horizontal tail was similar to that of the Viget, but the fin and rudder were much more rounded.  Because of the stagger, the mainwheels were in front of the lower wing, braced to the lower fuselage logeron aft to the front wing spar and forward to a point roughly below the upper wing leading edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "A most unusual feature of the Vagabond was the method of longitudinal trimming.  Rather than changing the angle of the tailplane with respect to the fuselage, the whole rear part of the fuselage was hinged just ahead of the lower wing's trailing edge.  This was controlled via a handwheel between the two cockpits; the rear fuselage was raised at the start of a landing descent to increase drag and slow the aircraft.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early flight trials, with H.J.Pain as pilot revealed a need to stiffen the engine mountings.  When this was done, the Vagabond, now fitted with a three-cylinder 1,095 cc Blackburne Thrush radial engine flew well enough at Lympne, but was eliminated in the preliminary rounds.  Only one Vagabond, registered  as G-EBJF on 1 July 1924 was built.  It was deregistered on 24 January 1928.\n",

Kunda can also play as a defensive midfielder. Kunda had a contract with RoPS until the end of season 2012.\n",

      "Kunda was one of the Zambians who came to RoPS in 2007. He came along with Nchimunya Mweetwa, Chanda Mwaba, Chileshe Chibwe and Zeddy Saileti's younger brother Derik Saileti for a trial. Quintet (Mweetwa, Kunda, Chibwe, Mwaba) got contract's with RoPS. Kunda signed with RoPS 3-years long contract including 2-years option. Later season he extended his contract to 2012. After the season RoPS won promotion to Veikkausliiga (Finnish Premier Division).\n",
      "\n",
      "Originally in RoPS, Kunda was considered to play as a defensive midfielder, but he was later dropped to defence after RoPS had some injuries and bans with their defenders. Kunda performed well in central defence and subsequently, he was made regular central defender. Kunda has good technical skill and keeps cool head even under pressure from opposite players. During the 2010 season Kunda has played in the midfield position, while Jarkko Lahdenmäki has been the starting defender with American Etchu Tabe.\n",

      "In Sri Lanka many farmers depend on animal husbandry for their livelihood, but not a large proportion. Therefore, many livestock products have to be imported. The main livestock products in Sri Lanka are milk, meat and eggs. Hides, wools and other products are still not produced within the country. Animal power formerly used in the cultivation of rice and vegetables have been replaced by modern technology to farmlands. However animal husbandry plays an important role in the rural economy for improving the living conditions of farmers in the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "The land area of Sri Lanka is 65,610 km2. and of this, 30% belongs to agricultural activities. From that 30%, 70% is solely devoted to crop production. The remainder consists of a mixture of crops and livestock. Hence, a very small proportion of the farmland is solely devoted to livestock production. In Sri Lanka, livestock sector contributes around 1.2% of the national GDP. Livestock is spread throughout all regions of Sri Lanka with concentrations of certain farming systems in particular areas due to cultural, market and agro-climatic reasons. According to statistics from the Department of Animal Production and Health, there are about 1.3 million cattle, 0.3 million buffalo, 0.4 million goats, 13 million poultry and 0.08 million pigs in the country with negligible numbers of sheep, ducks and other animal breeds.\n",

      "\n",
      "The per capita consumption of milk and dairy products in Sri Lanka (about 36 kg) is less, compare to other countries in the South Asian region. Since the 1980s Sri Lanka import dry milk powder as their main dairy commodity from Australia and New Zealand up to now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Main dairy/meat products\n",
      "A very few types of dairy products are locally processed by a few companies as well as household producers in the country. The most leading product among them is yoghurt and hundreds of trade names are available to buy it.  Other main dairy products are ice cream, curd, ghee, liquid milk (pasteurized and flavoured), cheese and some sweets.\n",
